# Take Home Problem: Surveyor Travel

## Brief

A mobile surveyor is looking for a system to optimise the order that she
visits the many sites on her job list. She has a list of locations with
their coordinates. It is up to you to create a solution in Python (making
use of appropriate libraries) to take the list and create a new list with
the order of where she should go to minimise the total distance she has to
travel. As she is mobile, she is not worried about a start location, or
time constraints at this point. However, the script needs to complete within
one minute on a normal laptop with a reasonably good solution.

## Instructions

### Setup
Make sure you are setup with a fairly recent version of Python.

Install the required dependencies : `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Run unit tests

`pytest`
